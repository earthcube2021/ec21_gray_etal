Using this notebook template is recommended for submissions to EarthCube events and competitions.<br>

The template comes in two versions. The short version includes just the rubrics with minimal instructions. The long version includes submission instructions, formatting examples, and references.

Any of these template versions can be installed in your Jupyter environment using the jupytemplate extension (as described in the long version), so that you start a new notebook with the template. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the rubrics into your notebook.
